Virus spread faster than human
Viruses in a patient, so the more virus, the more sick the patient

simulation:
- Try to clear virus
- If alive virus reproduce

Patien clear is a fixed variable
Virus reproduce is a changing variable


Prob 3

drug prevent virus from reproducing
the one with the resistance, reproduce

mutation add diversity
some virus gain resistance, some don't
